# On Productivity: Managing Communications
*“Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration. I try to learn certain areas of computer science exhaustively; then I try to digest that knowledge into a form that is accessible to people who don’t have time for such study.”*

—Donald Knuth

Email and Slack are insidious forms of distraction. They grant the illusion of productivity, but provide little by way actual accomplishments. In this article, I discuss my framework for managing these modes of communications.

## Email
Email is the to-do list anyone can add to. Therefore, its use should be finely tuned — all signal, no noise.

## Filtering Email
If you use Gmail or G Suite as your email service, filtering can be configured using the following:

**Gmail** > **Settings** > **See all settings** > **Filters and Blocked Addresses**

I filter email in two ways:
* Skip Inbox, Apply label "x"
* Skip Inbox, Mark as read

**Skip Inbox, Apply label "x"**
This configuration retains the email in a mailbox other than your inbox. Emails of this nature *may* require some review.

**Skip Inbox, Mark as read**
This configuration archives the email marks the email as read. Emails of this nature no not require review.

Currently, my only filter that uses a label is for **GitLab**, since my current company uses GitLab for source code.

## Unsubscribe From Everything
Take the time to click **unsubscribe** from all manner of emails. Also, if you want to know which companies are selling your email, append a key to your provided email:

* NickHKraus@gmail.com
* NickHKraus+Amazon@gmail.com

> Append a plus ("+") sign and any combination of words or numbers after your email address. For example, if your name was hikingfan@gmail.com, you could send mail to hikingfan+friends@gmail.com or hikingfan+mailinglists@gmail.com.

## Read Exactly 1 Newsletter
I have tried subscribing to more than one newsletter and end up with a bunch of flagged emails that I have convinced myself I will read later. I never do. I subscribe to Peter Attia’s newsletter. That’s it.

## Inbox Zero
I address my inbox exactly twice per day. All other times, my email client is closed. I do not turn on notifications, I do not show a badge of unread emails.

My inbox zero exercise comprises the following:
* Open each email in reverse chronological order.
* Determine email status: **Unsubscribe**, **Filter**, **Archive**, **Flag**, **Address**
	* **Unsubscribe**: Marketing email, promotional content, etc.
		* **Action**: Immediately unsubscribe from further emails.
	* **Filter**: Work-related or personal emails that I can not unsubscribe from.
		* **Action**: Create a filter. Usually, **Skip Inbox, Mark as read**.
	* **Archive**: Not worth reading or reviewing. Can not unsubscribe. Not worth making a filter.
		* **Action**: Archive. (I use a keyboard shortcut: `CTRL + E`.
	* **Flag**: May be worth reading or will require more time to review.
		* **Action**: Flag and move on.
	* **Address**: Urgent *and* low effort. This status is seldom used.
		* **Action**: Address email.

All flagged emails and filtered emails that I care to read are addressed at a later time. My inbox zero exercise should take 15 minutes at most.

## Addressing Flagged and Filtered Emails
Flagged emails may require my attention or warrant a thorough reading. In most cases flagged emails are not as important as I originally believed and are archived. If I deem an email worthy of significant time, a to-do list item is created with information contained in the email.

In this way, work is scheduled and groom. My inbox is not my to-do list. Not even my to-do list is my to-do list, since I ruthlessly prune tasks created by my past self. I will discuss to-do list and task management in a future post.

## Conclusion
*Most emails are unimportant and those that are important, usually resolve themselves.*

If you must tend to your email like a gardener tends to her prize-winning garden, I feel for you. As for me, I would sooner raze it all to the ground, then meticulously separate the important from the frivolous.

## Slack
Slack has fundamentally (and in my opinion, negatively) changed the way in which modern teams work. Slack allows you to take someone’s attention in an instant with the expectation that they will respond immediately. Such a demand rarely well-received leading to an ambient level of anxiety for teams where such expectations are established.

The use of Slack for knowledge sharing has selected for speed instead of clarity. How many times have you been typing a response only to have some else send a message before you? Such a way of thinking breed reactionary and incomplete thinking.

Finally, Slack foments an unabiding sense of FOMO, as if every message may contain some life-altering insight.

## Quality Over Quantity
I always tell myself that I will be a good steward of Slack. That today I will reach Slack zero. That today I will respond to questions with such celerity as to arose suspicions of my omnipotence.

In reality, this is hardly ever the case and I end up `SHIFT` + `ESC` ing a days worth of messages.

For this reason I have become ruthless in my Slack usage.
* I am a member of eleven channels.
* I mute six.
* I watch three.
* I read two.

Having to read only two channels may account of 10-15 minutes of reading per day. I may drop into these channels 2-3 times per day. In all other cases, my Slack client is closed.

If something is so urgent as to require my immediate attention, I have established the expectation with my colleagues, that it is acceptable to `@` me.

## Conclusion
Slack seems poised to become the communicate media *du jour* even though its use undermines the slow, thoughtful manner in which knowledge should be created and shared. For this reason, I am highly suspicious of its long-term utility as a cognitive artifact and concern it a necessary evil.

## All Other Communication
It 99% of cases, there is absolutely no need to be alerted by push notification or SMS messages. The constant interruption and distraction erodes one’s ability to enter a state of flow.

My prescription? Turn **all** notifications off. Turn off notification badges. Put your phone on **Do not disturb**.

The only time I will accept push notifications is when on-call. In which case, push notifications are allowed from a single iOS application. In addition, I have favorited those in my life who may get a hold of me via a phone call when my phone is on **Do not disturb**.
